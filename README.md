## Description
This repo includes a finish pipeline drawing on all the different skills learned so far including: leveraging `Faker` to create list, writing and reading JSON files, using a `@pytest.mark.parametrize()` to test a function, utilizing list and dictionary comprehensions.

Additional validation of the type of items inside of a list is included. The `removes_dups()` includes a check where if items inside of the list are not a `str` type then it will print to the user to "Please input a list with strings inside."  I

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Go to https://github.com/rgiosa10/python-adv-cr.git to find the specific repository for this website.
* Then open your terminal. I recommend going to your Desktop directory:
    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```
* Then clone the repository by inputting: 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rgiosa10/python-adv-cr.git
  ```
* Go to the new directory or open the directory folder on your desktop:
  ```bash
  cd python-adv-cr
  ```
* Once in the directory you will need to set up a virtual environment in your terminal:
  ```bash
  python3.7 -m venv venv
  ```
* Then activate the environment:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
* Install the necessary items with requirements.txt:
  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* With your virtual environment now enabled with proper requirements, open the directory:
  ```bash
  code .
  ```
